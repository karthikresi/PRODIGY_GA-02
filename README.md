Prodigy Infotech Internship – Generative AI
Task 2: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

This repository contains my completed submission for Task 2 of the Generative AI Internship at Prodigy Infotech. The goal of this task was to generate images from text prompts using pre-trained image generation models.

Task Objective:
To explore and utilize text-to-image generation using models such as DALL·E Mini and understand how generative models can be used for creative visual outputs.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Google Colab

Python

DALL·E Mini (Craiyon API)

Transformers

Gradio (for web interface)


What I Did:

Implemented a notebook that takes text prompts and generates corresponding images using pre-trained generative models.

Tested with multiple prompts like:

Circle with gradient

Comillas Negras

Futuristic city with sunset lighting


Displayed the generated images in the notebook.
